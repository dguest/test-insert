1.1.1 : last sentence, considerable maybe exaggerates the uncertainty. Fragmentation is rarely the dominant uncertanty these days
> changed to "Analyses which depend heavily on jets (one of which is the subject of this thesis) must account for this uncertainty."

1.1.2 : second paragraph. arise is the wrong verb. Is described by would be more accurate
> changed

1.1.2 : just before the reference to equation 1.4, you have the word equation twice

Section 2.2.1, second to last paragraph. Discoveries at hadron colliders. The discoveries at e+e- colliders obey simpler rules. The b quark was discovered at an e+e- collider.

2.2.2 : second paragraph. An unusual (not in the good sense) reason for why pT, instead of p
> FIXME: I don't get it

2.2.4 : stable particles - hadrons don't form jets. Jets consist mainly of hadrons. Quarks and gluons form jets. (I'm sure you know this, but the wording is odd. Are you maybe misusing hadrons as quark? Hadrons are baryons and mesons)

Section 2.5.2 : hadronic calorimeter. I doubt it is frequently. Occasionally is, I guess, more correct. maybe give lambda for the EM calorimeter.

Section 2.5.2 : Hadronic Calorimter. Grouped into three.

Section 2.5.2 : forward calorimeter. It is not saturated with minimum bias events, it is saturated with particles from minimum bias events

Section 2.5.2 : Trigger. maybe a mention of the event size would be appropriate?

Section 2.6 derivations? Really?

Section 2.6.2 The event weights are not corrections. They are a method of doing the calculation.

Section 2.6.2 QCD becomes dominant. You mean strong? It always dominates in dijet production.

Section 2.6.2 Which describe them can

Section 2.6.2 GEANT4 does not simulate the analog readout of the sensors. That code was (and has to be) written by ATLAS members.

Section 2.6.2 the spacing of grid points does not need to be regular. Sometimes they are denser near where you expect a limit. Sometimes they are in bins of equal cross section.

3.1 I have to admit that I find explaining a c quark as a downstream end of a b quark decay a bit odd. Surely in this thesis you are not just looking for charm from b decays? If so, why explain it this way?

3.1 I don't so far the extension of these methods don't you mean until this thesis, the extension of these methods?

3.1 I don't think you have given a geometrical definition of impact parameter yet

3.1 last paragraph. Expected performance? Surely measured performance?

3.2. Downstream?

3.2 Why mention GEANT again?

Section 3.2 you don't have a chapter on particle reconstruction. For this thesis, given the detail you gave on the detector and the accelerator, you should atleast describe what an anti-kt jet is.

Section 3.3 : I guess the charm jets in the ttbar sample are from W decay?

Section 3.4 : I have no idea what "Before applying c-tagging, expected signal events contriubte to the signal region at the percent level, while top background contribute roughly 10% and the remaining events are split evenly between W and Z production in association with jets" means.

Fig 4.14, left: awfully big scale factor at low pT

3.15 awefully big scale factors. Any idea why the mc is doing so badly?

Just before equation 3.2 misspelling of explicit

First paragraph of 3.7.3, misspelling of havent

You write jetfittercharm, right? Did you write GAIA?

First paragraph 3.8 misspelt trade off

Seems you could have done more to investigate the drop off in efficiency at high pT (fig 3.21)

Section 4.1 in when

4.1.1 not really a good description of the role luminosity plans

4.1.1 this is a very odd sentence "The ATLAS SUSY group quotes CLs values do to the ingrained perception that they posses useful properties"

The explicet formula for the boost correction would have been nice

Do you do charm tagging in the borrowed boosted analysis? Or do you just use its results as is?

4.2.1 for the madgraph samples, did you just run the LO? Or did you do ccbar+1jet, ccbar+2jets, etc? If so, how many extra jets were simulated?

fig 4.2 this is not really thesis quality

Section 4.4 "can easily resemple a jet from QCD interactions in the underlying event" do you really want that last phrase? It is not really correct.

You need references for the various electron and muon finding algorithms.

4.6 figure figure 4.6

4.6 t->bnu??

non-b-lead where one of these jest is a c-jet. Couldn't it be a light quark jet?

Fig 4.5 left does not look like it is after the delta phi cut. Also, why do you call it ptmiss in the caption and etmiss in the figure?

You refer to figure 4.8 before 4.7 (and 4.9 before either)

Grammar A leading jet is required pT > 130 GeV, s

4.7 Compared to the past, which are still relatively unknown at LHC energy scales is not true. It is amazingly well constrained, but still not perfect

Section 4.7.1 how many events are in each of these control regions?

4.7.3 the W and Z should be correlated, no? Does putting that constraint in help?

4.9 you really worried about two 1.3 sigma discrepancies?

Figure 4.10 should show that 1.3 sigma discrepency? In these plots, the integral of the data is 1.3 sigma lower than the postfit (on the right)?

Figure 4.10

Table 4.9, are these uncertainties pre or post fit?

From appendix C, it does look like there is some mismodeling in the MC, no. Especially for the Ws and Zs? Why not comment on this in the body of the thesis? (are these plots pre or post fit?)

It would be nice to have plots in teh appendix for the control regions as well? Appendix C is the validation regions, right?
