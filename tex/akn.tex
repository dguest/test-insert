%% The best part of being in physics is that you never have to grow up.
%% You're constantly learning, and collared shirts are only as common as b'nei mitzvah.

%% Most graduate students only get one adviser. Somehow I got three.
It's difficult attribute five years of my life to a single person, but I can say with confidence that I owe my time at CERN to Keith Baker.
Without him my experience in Europe would still be limited to connecting flights.
Thanks, Keith, for introducing me to high energy physics.
In my first several years at CERN I also had the privilege to work with Moustapha Thioye.
His wisdom in all aspects of collider physics, CERN, and the French Republic/bureaucracy laid the foundations of my life in the greater Geneva area.

%% The work described in this thesis
My later work as a graduate student was jointly supervised by Paul Tipton and Tobias Golling.
A tireless dispenser of ideas and enthusiasm, Tobias was a driving force behind everything I've accomplished.
At the same time, Paul's calm and holistic perspective has kept my priorities in check.
I owe them both endless gratitude for their guidance.
 %% Both are sharp as physicists and cordial as human beings; both were better advisers than I deserve.

Thanks also to Witold Skiba, the fourth member of my thesis committee, for explaining everything.

Many necessary pieces of the analysis described here were contributed by the Oxford SUSY group, in particular Will Kalderon, my fellow workhorse, and Alan Bar, who shepherded us through the \atlas\ approval process much faster than I thought possible.
Alex Dafinca, Anna Henrichs, and Clare Gwenlan also contributed considerable work.

Many others deserve thanks here as well.
To spare my readers any further delays I won't list them now.
These colleagues and friends will be acknowledged in the coming days.
