%% You're constantly learning, and collared shirts are only as common as b'nei mitzvah.

It's difficult attribute five years of my life to a single person, I can say with confidence that I owe my time at CERN to Keith Baker.
Without him my experience in Europe would still be limited to connecting flights.
Thanks, Keith, for introducing me to high energy physics.
In my first two years at CERN I also had the privilege to work with Moustapha Thioye.
His wisdom in all aspects of collider physics, CERN, and the French bureaucracy laid the foundations of my life in the greater Geneva area.

The work described in this thesis was jointly supervised by Paul Tipton and Tobias Golling.
I was amazed by their differences outside their

While completing the work described in this thesis, I had the fortune to be coadvised by .
Without Tobias Golling's inexhaustible drive I never would have tried so many things; without Paul Tipton's calm and thoughtful perspective I probably would have lost my mind.
