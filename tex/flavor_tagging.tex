Final states including $c$-jets can arise from a number of interesting processes at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
Some of these, including Beyond the Standard Model $H \to c\bar{c}$ production~\cite{charminghiggs} and SUSY models in which the lightest scalar quark decays to $c$-quarks~\cite{stoptocharm}, could be observed in LHC data.
Unfortunately, in the absence of a designated $c$-quark jet ($c$-jet) identification algorithm, such searches are forced to contend with large Standard Model backgrounds: multijet production, $b$-quark jet ($b$-jet) backgrounds from $t\bar{t}$ decays, other electroweak processes, and $H \to b\bar{b}$ production can all overwhelm the $c$-jet signal.
Assuming these backgrounds can be controlled, these searches have little sensitivity to the flavor couplings of a signal.
To address these problems, a dedicated algorithm to identify $c$-jets ($c$-tagging) has been developed and applied to data collected by the ATLAS detector~\cite{DetPap}.

Flavor-tagging algorithms within ATLAS fall into two categories; those which identify $b$- and $c$-hadrons by their soft lepton decay products, and `lifetime-based' methods which rely on the displacement of the $b$- and $c$-hadron decay products with respect to the primary vertex.
The branching ratio of $c$-hadrons to leptons places an upper limit on the efficiency of soft-lepton based $c$-jet tagging algorithms, which restricts their usefulness for many analyses and as such has not been pursued further at this point.
Lifetime-based methods are generally much more efficient and are well established in $b$-jet identification ($b$-tagging), but so far the extension of these methods to $c$-tagging is less developed.

Lifetime-based tagging can be further divided into two general approaches. The first approach is based on the `impact parameter' (IP) of tracks formed by charged particles in the inner tracking detector with respect to the primary vertex. Impact parameter based tagging algorithms exploit the small IP generally associated to tracks within light-flavored ($u$,$d$,$s$,gluon) jets (light-jets). Tracks from heavy hadron decays, by contrast, generally have a larger IP resulting from the displacement of the decay vertex. The second lifetime-based approach involves explicitly reconstructing at least one `secondary vertex' (SV) from tracks within the jet and categorizing the jet based on the SV properties.

A lifetime-based $c$-tagging algorithm must discriminate against two major backgrounds, $b$- and light-jets, and for most characteristics $c$-jets lie between these two extremes, making isolating
them particularly challenging.
In terms of light-jet discrimination, $c$-tagging algorithms are less powerful than $b$-tagging algorithms as a result of the smaller decay vertex displacement for $c$-hadrons relative to $b$-hadrons\footnote{The mean $c\tau$, where $\tau$ is the particle's lifetime, for a $B$ meson is $\approx 492$~$\mu$m, while $c\tau$ for a $D^{\pm}$ ($D^0$) 
meson is only $\approx 312$ ($\approx 123$) $\mu$m~\cite{pdg2014}.}.
This results in smaller impact parameters and lower SV reconstruction efficiency, and thus in a significantly lower $c$-tagging efficiency to reach a light-jet rejection equal to that achieved by $b$-tagging algorithms.
On the other hand, it can be difficult to distinguish $c$-hadron candidates from $b$-hadrons because both can form a displaced SV
and $b$-hadrons overwhelmingly decay via $c$-hadrons~\cite{pdg2014}. Faced with these complications, the best discriminating variables between $b$- and $c$-jets are the secondary vertex properties, in particular the invariant mass of the charged particles forming the secondary vertex.

Despite the limitations, lifetime-based tagging algorithms are within the capabilities of the detector and require only minor additions to the existing $b$-tagging tools. This chapter describes the design of
one such tagging algorithm, JetFitterCharm, and presents the expected performance and calibration on 2012 data.
For Run 2 the additional new innermost pixel layer inserted into the ATLAS detector during 2014, denoted the Insertable B-Layer~\cite{IBLTDR}, is likely to increase $c$-tagging performance by significantly improving the impact parameter resolution for low momentum tracks.

\section{Data and Simulation Samples}
\label{tag:sec:data-and-simulation}

Plots in this chapter are produced with $\ttbar$ events corresponding to 8 TeV proton-proton collisions simulated with \textsc{Powheg+Pythia6}~\cite{powheg,pythia2} and \textsc{CT10}~\cite{CT10} parton distribution functions. Only $t\bar{t}$ decays with at least one downstream lepton are included. To simulate pileup, minimum bias interactions consistent with 2012 run conditions are generated with \textsc{Pythia8}~\cite{Pythia8} and overlaid on the $\ttbar$ events.
The propagation of particles through the detector and the detector response are modeled using \textsc{GEANT4}~\cite{geant}. The primary vertex is defined as the vertex with the largest sum of squared transverse momenta of the associated tracks.

Jets are reconstructed by clustering energy deposits in the calorimeter with the anti-$k_t$ algorithm~\cite{antikt} and a radius parameter of 0.4, where clusters are calibrated with local cluster weighting~\cite{LCJets}. Jet energy scale calibration and criteria to reject low quality jets are standard across most analyses of 2012 data, and are described in detail elsewhere~\cite{JES}. In this note, only jets with transverse momentum, $\pt$, above 20 GeV and $|\eta| < 2.5$ are considered.
To mitigate effects from pileup, jets with $\pt < 50\,\gev$ and $|\eta| < 2.4$ are rejected if less than half of the sum of track $\pt$ is associated with tracks matched to the primary vertex~\cite{2013JVF}. The same selection cuts are also applied for the data based calibrations presented in the second part of this document.

In the case of simulated jets, a flavor label is assigned by matching jets to generator level partons with $\pt > 5\,\gev$, after final state radiation, in a $\Delta R < 0.3$ cone. If a $b$-quark is found within the cone the jet is labeled as a $b$-jet. If no $b$-quark is found, the search is repeated for $c$-quarks, then for $\tau$ leptons. If no match is found for $b$, $c$, or $\tau$, the jet is labeled as a light-jet.

\section{Operating Points}

While the neural network produces three posterior probabilities, these sum to approximately 1 and thus contain one redundant degree of freedom. The three outputs are therefore projected into a 2-dimensional `anti-$b$' vs `anti-light' discriminant plane as shown in Fig.~\ref{tag:fig:2dcut}, where the anti-$b$ axis is defined as $\log (P_{c} / P_{b})$ and the anti-light axis as $\log (P_{c} / P_{\rm light})$; the variables are shown in \cref{fig:1dvars1,fig:1dvars2}. Operating points are defined by a pair of minimum thresholds; any jet in which both the anti-light and anti-$b$ discriminants exceed the thresholds is said to be `tagged'.

Two-dimensional distribution of the JetFitterCharm anti-$b$ ($\log(P_c/P_b)$) and anti-light ($\log(P_c/P_{\rm light})$) discriminants. The density of red, green, and blue reflect the density of $b$, $c$, and light jets, white areas are a mix of all three flavors, whereas black areas lack any jets. The `medium' calibrated operating point selects jets above a certain threshold in both anti-$b$ and anti-light discriminants.
Ridge structures arise from two features of the algorithm which concentrate values in the input space. The first feature is the use of discrete kinematic bin inputs, $\eta^{\rm cat}$ and $\pt^{\rm cat}$. The second is the substitution of default values when the ordinary input values would not be physically meaningful, for example when no secondary vertex is found. The resulting high density structures can be seen in the lower-center and upper-left region of the plot.}

Charm tagging, being relatively new to the LHC, is unable to draw on extensive past experience in physics analyses to define ideal operating points. The operating points were therefore defined with a SUSY $\tilde{t}$ pair production search~\cite{stoptocharm} as a prototype. In this particular model, the $\tilde{t}$ quarks decay via $\tilde{t} \to c \tilde{\chi}_1^0$, leading to a two-$c$-jet final state. Before applying $c$-tagging, expected signal events contribute to the signal region at the percent level, while top backgrounds contribute roughly 10\% and the remaining events are split evenly between $W$ and $Z$ production in association with jets. The anti-$b$ and anti-light tagging thresholds were allowed to vary independently for each of the leading four jets while maximizing the expected signal significance. %% $Z$, where \[Z  \equiv \frac{s}{ \sqrt{s + b + (\Delta b)^2}},\] and $s$ and $b$ are respectively the number of signal and background events passing the tagging requirements. The parameter $\Delta b$ accounts for systematic errors in the background, and is fixed at 0.3.

These studies demonstrated the need for two very different operating points. Anticipating cases where a light jet background dominates, a `medium' tag is defined to reject both light- and $b$-flavored jets. In other selections light jets are a smaller background and $\ttbar$ becomes dominant, so a second `loose' tag is defined which rejects over half of $b$ jets while accepting a larger fraction of $c$-jets. These operating points are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:ops}.

medium & $> -0.9$ & $> 0.95$ & 0.20 & 8.0 & 200 \\

\section{Performance}

The $c$-tagging efficiencies as a function of $\pt$ and $|\eta|$ for the medium and loose operating points are shown in \cref{fig:merged-eff}. Beyond the two currently calibrated operating points, many more combinations of anti-$b$ and anti-light thresholds could be useful, depending on a number of analysis-dependent factors such as the number of tags applied and the flavor composition of the dominant backgrounds.

  \end{center}
\end{figure}

The range of possible operating points is illustrated in two ways. The first, shown in \cref{fig:perf-roc}, gives the light-jet rejection as a function of $c$-jet efficiency for all possible values of the anti-light threshold ($x$-axis in \cref{tag:fig:2dcut}). In this case, the anti-$b$ threshold is adjusted to maintain a constant $b$-jet rejection. Similar information is given in \cref{fig:perf-iso} in the form of $c$-jet constant efficiency contours in the light- vs $b$-jet rejection plane. Both figures demonstrate the trade off between $b$-jet and light-jet rejection: e.g. for constant 30\% $c$-tagging efficiency an operating point can double its $b$-jet rejection at the expense of cutting the light-jet rejection by a factor of 10.

\section{JetFitterCharm Calibration}
\label{sec:calib}
Separate analyses are used to calibrate each of the three jet flavors.
The efficiency for tagging $b$-jets is determined from a measurement performed in dileptonic $t\bar{t}$ events with two or three jets, and is based on a combinatorial likelihood approach~\cite{Giacinto}.
The $c$-jet tagging efficiency has been calibrated in multijet events where jets contain $D^*$ mesons~\cite{bc2014}.
Light-jet scale factors are derived from a negative-tag analysis~\cite{bc2014}.
All three calibrations are performed as a function of jet transverse momentum and are provided in terms of scale factors, defined as the ratio of the tagging efficiencies measured in data to those predicted by simulation.
Light-jet scale factors are further binned as a function of $|\eta|$. No $\eta$-binning is used for $b$- and $c$-jet scale factors, as these scale factors have no significant dependence on jet $\eta$.
Figures~\ref{JFC_SF_B} and~\ref{JFC_SF_L1} give scale factors for all jets at the medium operating point. Figures~\ref{JFC_SF_B_loose} and~\ref{JFC_SF_L1_loose} give the same information for the loose operating point.
