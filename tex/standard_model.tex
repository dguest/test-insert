\section{The Standard Model}
Discuss how the standard model makes accurate predictions of phenomena: it's not supposed to explain everything.
\subsection{Electromagnetism}

This should still make sense for grandma.

Discuss visible matter: chemistry comes from quarks and electrons. Introduce Electromagnetic force.

It stops making sense for grandma here. Introduce QED and feynman diagrams informally.

\subsection{$W$ and $Z$ Bosons}
Start with electromagnetic force, move into weak interactions. Maybe mention UV divergence of Fermi interaction as justification for W and Z bosons.
\subsection{The Higgs Field}
Simplest possible explanation as to why we need a Higgs.

Talk about mass corrections from the top quark.
