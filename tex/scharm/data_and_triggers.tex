This analysis considered all data taken at the LHC in $\cmenergy$ proton-proton collisions, recorded beginning early 2012 and continuing throughout the year.
In this time, the LHC accumulated total of $20.3 \pm 2.8\%\,\invfb$ of integrated luminosity after various data-cleaning requirements were applied.
An additional $\sim 4.7\,\invfb$ of $\sqrt{s} = 7\,\tev$, taken in 2011, was not considered due to lower signal cross-sections, limited gain in data, and the complexity of combining datasets with different collision energies.

As discussed in \cref{sec:trigger}, only a very small fraction of collisions in ATLAS are ever recorded, so in addition to being measurable at the LHC, signatures must match events which fire a trigger.

\subsection{$\met$ Trigger}
\label{sec:met-trigger}
The signature of a $\sctoc$ decay is several $c$-jets plus $\met$.
Charm-tagging isn't currently implemented at trigger-level given the short timescales involved and the complexity of $c$-tagging.
This leaves generic jets and $\met$ as trigger options.
Jet triggers are unusable because the $\pt$ thresholds are above those required to trigger on $c$~jets from $\sctoc$.
This leaves only $\met$ triggers as a viable option. \Cref{fig:etmiss-triggers} shows the efficiency of the $\met$ trigger used in this analysis (\verb|EF_xe80_tclcw_tight|). While the trigger threshold is roughly $80 \,\gev$ by design, it only becomes $\gtrsim 99\%$ efficient at approximately $150\,\gev$ due to the limited resolution of online $\met$ reconstruction.
Typically data and simulation disagree somewhat in trigger efficiency; to mitigate any systematic uncertainty arising form this disagreement, events must satisfy an offline $\met > 150\,\gev$ requirement.

\subsection{Lepton Triggers}
Background estimation is discussed in more detail in \cref{sec:backgrounds}, but to control for the larger backgrounds, we also require data with 1 or 2 leptons.
The dominating background processes produce leptons through electroweak interactions, and thus give rise to roughly equal numbers of all three lepton generations.
Only electron and muon triggers are actually used in control regions, since $\tau$-leptons are exceptionally difficult to reconstruct and carry relatively large systematic uncertainties.
%% Of the three generations, $\tau$-leptons are exceptionally difficult to reconstruct and carry relatively large systematic uncertainties.
%% Thus $\tau$-leptons are ignored in control regions which constrain the dominant backgrounds; events within control regions are selected by muon and electron triggers.

\end{table}

In general, the lowest non-prescaled trigger which is available for the entire 2012 data set is used.
As with the $\met$ trigger, an offline threshold is required to ensure that the trigger is nearly $100\,\%$ efficient.
In control regions which require two leptons, dilepton triggers were considered since they allow lower offline $\pt$ thresholds (20 as opposed to 25 $\gev$).
These were rejected (see \cref{sec:dilepton-triggers}) because the final control region definitions included a leading lepton requirement $\pt > 70\,\gev$; lowering the $\pt$ threshold on the leading lepton added very few events, and a $\pt > 20\,\gev$ requirement on the second lepton removed many more.
All leptonic control regions thus used the single-lepton triggers listed in \cref{tab:lepton-triggers}. Each flavor combines two triggers: a low-$\pt$ trigger with lepton isolation requirements and a higher-$\pt$ trigger with no isolation requirements.
