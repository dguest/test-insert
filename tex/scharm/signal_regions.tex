As a 0-lepton search in a hadron collider, the $\sttoc$ search is forced to contend with a large multijet QCD background.
This background can be suppressed with an absolute $\met$ threshold, since most transverse momentum from QCD events should be captured by the ATLAS calorimeter and very little real $\met$ should exist.
To this end the search uses a $\met$ trigger, in addition to an offline threshold of $\met > 150\,\gev$.
After this requirement a small fraction of QCD events still remains; if a single energetic jet is badly mismeasured, the overall $\met$ can be pushed above threshold.
Fortunately this mismeasurement is statistically unlikely to effect more than a single jet in the event, and as a result the event $\vmet$ aligns with the jet momentum.
A distribution of $\Delta \phi(j,\vmet)$ is given in \cref{fig:jm-dphi}.
