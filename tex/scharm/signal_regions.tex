As a 0-lepton search in a hadron collider, the $\sttoc$ search is forced to contend with a large multijet QCD background.
This background can be suppressed with an absolute $\met$ threshold, since most transverse momentum from QCD events should be captured by the ATLAS calorimeter and very little real $\met$ should exist.
To this end the search uses a $\met$ trigger in addition to an offline threshold of $\met > 150\,\gev$.
After this requirement a small fraction of the original QCD events still remain; if a single energetic jet is badly mismeasured, the overall $\met$ can be pushed above threshold.

Fortunately this mismeasurement is statistically unlikely to effect more than a single jet in the event, and as a result the event $\vmet$ aligns with the jet momentum.
Data distributions of $\metdphi{j}$ and $\met$ after the $\met$ trigger, are given in \cref{fig:jm-dphi}.
The expected standard model backgrounds are also overlaid. Clearly the vast majority of events are accounted for with $\wjets$, $\zjets$, and $\ttbar$ after the $\met > 150\,\gev$ and $\metdphi{j} > 0.4$ requirements.
A very small excess of QCD events is still visible at low values of $\meteffshort \equiv \meteff$. In the signal region these events are removed with a $\meteffshort > 0.25$ requirement.

Following the anti-QCD cuts, the signal remains small relative to the SM backgrounds. As shown in figure \cref{fig:flavor-comp-presel}, the leading two jets in these two backgrounds are dominantly light flavored.
To reduce these backgrounds the two leading jets are $c$-tagged.
Each tag rejects over $99\%$ of light jets and over $80\%$ of $b$~jets, which reduces electroweak backgrounds by 4 orders of magnitude.
At the same time, applying two $c$~tags reduces the signal by a factor of 20.

After the $c$~tagging requirement, the number of $\wjets$, $\zjets$, and $\ttbar$ events are on similar within an order of magnitude.
These backgrounds can be further reduced thanks to several variables.
Among the most important is $\mct$, which was introduced in \cref{eq:mctdef}.
In the case of $b$-lead $\ttbar$ (decays where the leading two jets are $b$-jets), the boost-corrected $\mct$ is bound according to $\mct < 135\,\gev$~\cite{mctboost}.
In non-$b$-lead cases, where the two leading jets don't correspond to the $b$-jets in $t \to b \nu$, this bound no longer holds.
These cases give rise to the long tail of $\ttbar$ events shown in
\cref{fig:discrim-sr}.

\begin{itemize}
\item[$\pt^{\text{j1}}$:] The leading jet must have $\pt > 130\,\gev$ to reject generic backgrounds.
\item[$\pt^{\text{j2}}$:] Electroweak $W$/$Z$ + jet production often yields subleading jets with $\pt \lesssim 100\,\gev$. Events with $\pt^{\mathrm{j2}} < 100\,\gev$ are removed.
\item[$\mcc$:] Events with low values of the dijet mass of the leading two jets ($\mcc$) can also correspond to $\ttbar$ events where one of the leading jets is not from $t \to b \nu$. This is also a signature of $g \to b \bar{b}$ splitting.

Three signal regions are considered in the final analysis.
These regions correspond to $\mct < 150$, $200$, and $250\,\gev$.
