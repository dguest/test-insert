The reconstruction of jets and leptons is imperfect in any collider: a pion from a jet can resemble an electron; a $\tau$-lepton can resemble a jet; a $c$-jet can easily resemble a jet from QCD interactions in the underlying event.
Object definitions are thus a compromise between efficiency and fake rates.
Since events contain multiple objects, the optimal efficiencies and fake rates are very analysis dependent.
This section gives a detailed description of the object definitions in the $\sctoc$ search.

In general, objects are selected in three steps: first a ``preselected'' collection is formed for jets, electrons, and muons; next an overlap removal stage resolves ambiguity between objects, and finally ``signal'' objects are defined with more stringent quality requirements.

\subsection{Jets}
%% Hadronic QCD jets are orders of magnitude more common than leptons at the LHC.
%% They are also difficult to measure properly, since they consist of
Jets are formed from calorimeter clusters, which are clustered with the anti-$k_t$ algorithm~\cite{antikt} with a radius parameter of 0.4.
All jets are calibrated with a local cluster weighting~\cite{LCJets}.
In the case of simulated jets the same flavor labeling scheme as described in \cref{tag:sec:data-and-simulation} is applied. The preselected jets consist of all jets with with $\pt > 20\,\gev$. To remove electrons which have been reconstructed as jets, any jet with a preselected electron within $\Delta R < 0.2$ is discarded.

A number of quality requirements are applied to the preselected jets, as tabulated in \cref{tab:veryloosejet}. If a preselected jet fails any of these requirements, the entire event is discarded. These requirements rely on the following parameters:
\begin{description}
\item[$\emf$] The fraction of the jet energy deposited in the electromagnetic calorimeter.
\item[$\chf$] Charged jet fraction is defined as
  \begin{equation}
    \chf = \frac{\sum_{\text{tracks}} \pt^{\text{trk}}}{\pt^{\text{jet}}},
  \end{equation}
  where the sum is over all tracks associated to the jet.
