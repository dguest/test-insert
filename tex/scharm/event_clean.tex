While the LHC and ATLAS detector operated continuously through 2012 with very little down time, some data is inevitably corrupted by detector issues.
Relatively ``slow'' electronic or data acquisition issues are filtered with the help of a \emph{good runs list} (GRL).
Good runs lists are tailored to the demands of the analysis, since not all analyses require the same functional subsystems.
All runs recorded by ATLAS are broken into 1 minute \emph{lumi-blocks} which are reviewed by data quality ``shifters''.
Lumi-blocks with defects in critical subsystems removed.

 In addition some recorded events may result from noncollision background processes. In either case, events must be ``cleaned'' for analysis.
