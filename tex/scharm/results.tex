The $\cls$ limits~\cite{Read:2002hq} presented in this search are calculated
from a probability distribution function defined by a
 profile likelihood
fit. This fit attempts to normalize the number of signal and background
events such that:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the number of simulated events in the control and signal regions
  matches with data, and
\item the parameters normalizing each background and signal sample are
  consistent across all regions.
\end{enumerate}
Several types of floating parameters are used in the fit:
\begin{description}
\item[free parameters:] these constrain the
  overall normalization of the simulated $\wjets$,
  $\zjets$, $\ttbar$ + single $t$, and
  signal. Such parameters are initalized with a nominal value of 1,
  but the fit pays no penalty for values that deviate from the initial
  value.
\item[constrained parameters:] these
  parameters describe systematic variations. A gaussian restraint
  penalizes the fit when these values shift from the nominal
  value. The width of this restraint is derived from dedicated
  studies as discussed below.
\end{description}

The fit is implemented by a collection of stacked software packages,
standard to the ATLAS SUSY group. At the top level
HistFitter~\cite{histfitter} is used. This tool wrap the
HistFactory~\cite{histfactory} package, which creates RooFit
``workspaces''. These workspaces are fit, and $\cls$ is extracted, with
HistFitter functions (which in turn call RooFit /
RooStats). Systematic variations are categorized as ``experimental''
and ``theoretical''. The experimental systematics considered are described in \cref{sec:sys_experimental}.

\subsection{Theory Systematic Combination}

Theoretical systematics for the backgrounds are derived as described in \cref{sec:sys_theorybkg}. When running the fit, theory systematics are not directly applied as yield variations in each region. Instead, the systematics are used to derive ``transfer factors'' from the region that best constrains each background to the other regions used in the fit, and the uncertainty for each region is calculated {relative to the constraining region} using these transfer factors. Uncertainties calculated in this way are tabulated in \cref{tab:ttbar_theory_syst,tab:Wjets_theory_syst,tab:Zjets_theory_syst}. These uncertainties in are further combined into overall theory systematics (those of the form ``overall down stat'' and ``overall up stat''). There are two important notes about the above procedure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The theory systematics are calculated relative to the constraining region, meaning that the systematic variation {\em in} the constraining region is, by definition, zero.
\item Hypothetically, any region could be chosen as the constraining region for any background (e.g. we could quote uncertainties in every background relative to \crw). We choose to constrain the top backgrounds ($t + t \bar{t}$) using \crt, \wjets\ using \crw, and \zjets\ using \crz.
\end{enumerate}

Signal ISR and FSR uncertainties are described in \cref{sec:signal-isr-fsr}, and are added to the signal yields in all fits.
In accordance with SUSY group recommendations\footnote{See \url{https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/AtlasProtected/SUSYLimitPlotting}},
signal cross-section uncertainties are shown only in the ``observed''
limits. An uncertainty band on the observed limits is calculated by
running three separate fits for each signal point: a nominal fit with
no cross section systematics applied, and a fit with ``up'' and ``down''
variations added to the expected signal yield.

\section{Exclusions in the $\scharm$--$\neut$ Plane}

Lacking any data excess in the signal regions, we instead set 95\% $\cls$ exclusion limits in the scharm--neutralino mass plane, as shown in \cref{fig:plane_pretty_regions}. Upper limits for cross sections in the $\scharm$--$\neut$ plane are given in \cref{fig:exclusion_plane_ul}.

\end{figure}

The expected exclusion (based on the fit setup described in
appendix~\ref{app:fitResults}) is shown in
figure~\ref{fig:exclusion_plane_regions}. Three ``$\tilde{c}$'' fit
configurations---those described in this note---are considered, each
consisting of the three control regions and one of the three signal
regions defined by the $\mct$ requirement, for a total of four regions
per fit. In all cases the uncertainties describing JES, JER, tagging
uncertainties, MET cell-out scale and resolution and lepton ID
efficiency uncertainties are accounted for with additional fit
parameters. In addition, we considered two ``$\tilde{t}$'' signal
regions (C1 and C2) from the $\tilde{t} \to c
\neut$~\cite{CONF:stoptocharm:summer} analysis. While the $\tilde{c}$
signal regions were optimized for high $\Delta m \equiv m_{\scharm} - m_{\neut}$
signal points with two resolvable $c$-jets, these regions loose
sensitivity for low $\Delta m$ values, as shown in
\cref{fig:plane_regions_expected}. The $\tilde{t}$ regions, by
contrast, were optimized for ISR boosted $c$-jets, and are sensitive
to signal points with low $\Delta m$.

The five fit configurations are merged by taking the ``best'' configuration---that which is expected to exclude the signal with the highest confidence---for each signal point. Contours for the expected and observed exclusion are drawn by interpolating between signal points. Simple linear interpolation of $\cls$, however,  is known to introduce a bias because $\cls$ is relatively non-linear as a function of both $\scharm$ and $\neut$ mass. Following the precedent from previous SUSY searches~\cite{susy-limit-setting}, the $\cls$ values at each signal point are transformed to Gaussian significance $Z$ using the Gaussian inverse cumulative distribution function. Linear interpolation is then used to define $Z(m_{\scharm}, m_{\neut})$ for all points in the plane and draw contours where $Z(m_{\scharm}, m_{\neut}) = Z_{95 \% \text{ CL}} \approx 1.645$.

Exclusions from individual fit configurations are given in \cref{fig:exclusion_plane_ul}, along with 95\% $\cls$ $\scharm$ cross-section upper limits. %% The interpolation in the \scharm--\neut plane is discussed further in \cref{sec:cls-interpolation}, while
Cross-checks of indivial signal points are discussed in \cref{sec:fit-signal-points}.

\subsection{Model Independent Upper Limits}
\label{sec:model-independent-ul}

Model independent upper limits on non--Standard Model physics are
derived using a ``discovery'' fit, in which we assume the hypothetical
process only contributes to the signal region yield and leaves the
control regions unaffected. One discovery fit is run for each signal
region. This fit is considerably simpler than the exclusion fit:
whereas the exclusion fit accounts for all systematic variations and
fits the control and signal regions simultaneously, each discovery fit
considers a single signal region with a single combined background
estimate. Expected standard model background yields, observed yields,
and a single overall background uncertainty are taken directly from
\cref{tab:SRyields}. Fit results are converted to upper limits by
solving for $\cls(\mu) = 0.05$, where $\mu$ is the signal
strength. The $\cls(\mu)$ values themselves are calculated with both
asymptotic formulae~\cite{asymptotics} and by running with 3000
pseudo-experiments to derive test statistic distributions.  The result
is a 95\% $\cls$ upper limit on the visible cross section, as summarized
in \cref{tab:model-ind-lim}.

signal events, given the expected number (and $\pm 1\sigma$
excursions on the expectation) of background events.

the background-only hypothesis, and the discovery $p$-value ($p(s = 0)$).}
