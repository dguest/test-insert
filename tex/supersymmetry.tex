\section{Supersymmetry}
\label{sec:susy}

Supersymmetry~\cite{sggs,duelfermions,susywes} extends the standard model by adding an additional symmetry between fermions and bosons. This creates \emph{superpartners} for each of the particles, which differ in spin by $1/2$, but are otherwise identical to their standard model counterparts.
A generic SM superpartner is referred to as a \emph{sparticle}.
Supersymmetry cancels the unnatural tuning discussed in \cref{sec:naturalness} by introducing corrections which are identical in magnitude to those in \cref{eq:higgs-deltam}, but opposite in sign.

While this is a miraculous result, this simple model also has a fatal flaw; it predicts sparticles with masses identical to their SM counterparts.
To date, no such sparticles have been observed, despite a huge number of experiments which should have been sensitive to them; this simple model is clearly not enough.
SUSY can be salvaged by adding \emph{soft} supersymmetry breaking terms ($\lagr_{\text{soft}}$), such that the total lagrangian can be written as
\begin{equation}
  \lagr = \lagr_{\text{SUSY}} + \lagr_{\text{soft}},
\end{equation}
where $\lagr_{\text{SUSY}}$ is essentially $\lagr_{\text{SM}}$ augmented with superpartners.
Many theories connect $\lagr_{\text{soft}}$ to gravitation and other Planck-scale physics~\cite{olive}, but for the purposes of this thesis the details are less important than the overall effect. By coupling superpartners to additional spontaneously broken symmetries at higher energies, the soft terms add additional mass to the sparticles and push their masses above those of the SM particles.

From one perspective the $\lagr_{\text{soft}}$ terms verge on pseudoscience; they are a magic wand to make all the unobserved sparticles disappear, leaving an elegant theory which can't be falsified.
Fortunately, the soft terms don't completely void the naturalness problem---they merely mitigate it.
With the soft terms included, the new Higgs correction is
\begin{equation}
  \Delta m_{h}^2 = m_{\text{soft}}^2 \left[ \frac{\Gamma}{16 \pi^2} \ln(\cutoff / m_{\text{soft}}) + \ldots \right],
\end{equation}
where $\Gamma$ stands in for an arbitrary dimensionless coupling which should be of order one in a less contrived theory.
Introducing a realistic SUSY model thus replaces a $\Delta m_{h}$ correction of order $\Lambda_{\mathrm{GUT}}$ with one of order $m_{\text{soft}}$.
While this doesn't \emph{solve} the falsifiability issue, a measure of naturalness does give the theory a measure of credibility (or lack thereof).
The naturalness of SUSY relies on $m_{\text{soft}}$ terms (and sparticle masses) which aren't too far above the electroweak scale. Assuming $m_{\text{soft}} \lesssim 1\,\tev$, SUSY should be accessible at the LHC.

\subsection{The Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model}

Reflecting the boson-fermion symmetry, each SM field and its superpartner is condensed into a \emph{supermultiplet}. The simplest realistic SUSY model is the \emph{Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model} (MSSM), which contains one supermultiplet for each standard model field. For reasons that will be discussed below, the MSSM also introduces a second Higgs doublet.
A summary of these particles is given in \cref{tab:mssm}

The superpartners follow a naming convention which distinguishes them from their SM counterparts. The superpartners to the fermions are prefixed with an `s', leading to the sleptons (selectrons, smuons, staus), the sneutrinos, and the squarks (stop, scharm, etc.). The superpartners to the bosons are suffixed with `-ino', leading to the gluinos, the winos, binos and the higgsinos. More simply, they are represented as the SM symbol with a tilde i.e.~$\tilde{t}$ for a stop quark.

The MSSM, as mentioned above, adds a second Higgs doublet. This field is added in response to several problems which arise when extending the SM to SUSY. First, the MSSM Yukawa couplings must be holomorphic; the $\tilde{\phi}$ field in \cref{eq:yuk} isn't allowed, which leaves no Yukawa couplings (and thus no masses) for up-type quarks. Secondly, the triple-gauge coupling ``anomalies''---which cancel in the standard model but would otherwise violate gauge invariance---no longer cancel when higgsinos are added. Adding a second Higgs doublet with opposite hypercharge solves both problems. Yukawa couplings for up-type quarks are supplied by the uncharged component of the new Higgs field, and the gauge anomalies from both Higgs fields cancel each other. These two Higgs fields mix to form three neutral scalar ``Higgs'' bosons: $h^0$, $H^0$, and $A^0$; and two charged bosons: $H^+$ and $H^-$. By convention, $h^0$ is the lightest Higgs; so far this particle is indistinguishable from the observed SM Higgs.

As in the standard model, where the manifestly gauge-invariant $A$ and $B$ fields mix to become the $W$, $Z$ and $\gamma$, the most useful SUSY fields at tree-level are mixtures those given in \cref{tab:mssm}. In the MSSM, the $\tilde{A}^1$ and $\tilde{A}^2$ fields mix with the charged higgsinos to form the \emph{charginos}, $\tilde{\chi}^\pm_1$ and $\tilde{\chi}^\pm_2$. In addition $\tilde{A}^3$ and $\tilde{B}$ mix with the neutral higgsino fields to form the \emph{neutralinos}, $\tilde{\chi}_1^0$, $\tilde{\chi}_2^0$, $\tilde{\chi}_3^0$, and $\tilde{\chi}_4^0$. By convention, the neutrilinos are labeled by ascending mass.

The lightest neutrilino, $\neut$, is stable under the assumptions that SUSY conserves \emph{$R$-parity}, i.e.~that terms which violate lepton or baryon number are forbidden, and that the $\neut$ is the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). The first assumption, $R$-parity conservation, is somewhat \emph{ad hoc} and not strictly needed in SUSY models. It is frequently included because the alternative---$R$-parity violation---must be carefully tuned to avoid unphysical predictions like proton decay.
As a consequence of $R$-parity conservation, interactions must include sparticles in pairs---a single sparticle can only decay to another sparticle and some number of SM particles.
This requirement stabilizes the LSP; after being produced, it is left with no kinematically allowed decays and wonders the universe indefinitely until it annihilates with another sparticle.

Whether the LSP is charged or neutral depends on free parameters of the MSSM. A charged LSP, however, would form bound states with SM particles.
Given that no such states have been observed~\cite{chargedlsp} a charged LSP seems unlikely. A neutral LSP, on the other hand, should interact only through the weak force and gravitation. SUSY enthusiasts tout this prediction of a \emph{weakly interacting massive particle} (WIMP) as a major success of the theory; as discussed in \cref{sec:dm} considerable astronomical evidence supports the existence of such a particle.
