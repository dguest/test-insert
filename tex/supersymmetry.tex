\section{Supersymmetry}
\label{sec:susy}

Supersymmetry~\cite{susywes} extends the standard model by adding an additional symmetry between fermions and bosons.

\begin{itemize}
\item Cite~\cite{susywes}, talk about supermultiplets
\item point out that string theory relies on this
\item Spectrum (before and after breaking)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Breaking SUSY and Naturalness}
\begin{itemize}
\item Give the $\Delta m_{H}$ equation that shows how SUSY makes SM more natural.
\item Mention that this suggests SUSY near the TeV scale
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Dark Matter and Unification}
The ``other merits of SUSY'' chapter
\begin{itemize}
\item Cosmologists take dark matter as fact.
\item Cite WMAP results
\item Grand unification is suggestive
\end{itemize}
\subsection{LHC exclusions}
leaves the situation rather un-natural
\subsection{Supersymmetric Charm}
\label{sec:supercharm}
\begin{itemize}
\item this hasn't been checked before
\item include Feynman diagram of signal
\end{itemize}
