\section{Supersymmetry}
\label{sec:susy}

Supersymmetry~\cite{sggs,duelfermions,susywes} extends the standard model by adding an additional symmetry between fermions and bosons. This creates \emph{superpartners} for each of the particles, which differ in spin by $1/2$, but are otherwise identical to their standard model counterparts. Reflecting this symmetry, each SM field and its superpartner is condensed into a \emph{supermultiplet}. The simplest realistic SUSY model is the \emph{Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model} (MSSM), which contains one supermultiplet for each standard model field. For reasons that will be discussed below, the MSSM also introduces a second Higgs doublet.
A summary of these particles is given in \cref{tab:mssm}

The superpartners follow a naming convention which distinguishes them from their SM counterparts. The superpartners to the fermions are prefixed with an `s', leading to the sleptons (selectrons, smuons, staus), the sneutrinos, and the squarks (stop, scharm, etc.). The superpartners to the bosons are suffixed with `-ino', leading to the gluinos, the winos, binos and the higgsinos. A generic superpartner is referred to as a \emph{sparticle}. More simply, they are represented as the SM symbol with a tilde i.e.~$\tilde{t}$ for a stop quark.

The MSSM, as mentioned above, adds a second Higgs doublet. This field is added in response to several problems which arise when extending the SM to SUSY. First, the MSSM Yukawa couplings must be holomorphic; the $\tilde{\phi}$ field in \cref{eq:yuk} isn't allowed, which leaves no Yukawa couplings (and thus no masses) for up-type quarks. Secondly, the triple-gauge coupling ``anomalies''---which cancel in the standard model but would otherwise violate gauge invariance---no longer cancel when higgsinos are added. Adding a second Higgs doublet with opposite hypercharge solves both problems. Yukawa couplings for up-type quarks are supplied by the uncharged component of the new Higgs field, and the gauge anomalies from both Higgs fields cancel each other. These two Higgs fields mix to form three neutral scalar ``Higgs'' bosons: $h^0$, $H^0$, and $A^0$; and two charged bosons: $H^+$ and $H^-$. By convention, $h^0$ is the lightest Higgs; so far this particle is indistinguishable from the observed SM Higgs.

As in the standard model, where the manifestly gauge-invariant $A$ and $B$ fields mix to become the $W$, $Z$ and $\gamma$, the most useful SUSY fields at tree-level are mixtures those given in \cref{tab:mssm}. In the MSSM, the $\tilde{A}^1$ and $\tilde{A}^2$ fields mix with the charged higgsinos to form the \emph{charginos}, $\tilde{\chi}^\pm_1$ and $\tilde{\chi}^\pm_2$. In addition $\tilde{A}^3$ and $\tilde{B}$ mix with the neutral higgsino fields to form the \emph{neutralinos}, $\tilde{\chi}_1^0$, $\tilde{\chi}_2^0$, $\tilde{\chi}_3^0$, and $\tilde{\chi}_4^0$. By convention, the neutrilinos are labeled by ascending mass.

The lightest neutrilino, $\neut$, is stable under the assumptions that SUSY conserves \emph{$R$-parity}, i.e.~that terms which violate lepton or baryon number are forbidden, and that the $\neut$ is the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). The first assumption, $R$-parity conservation, is somewhat \emph{ad hoc} and not strictly needed in SUSY models. It is frequently included because the alternative---$R$-parity violation---must be carefully tuned to avoid unphysical predictions like proton decay.
As a consequence of $R$-parity conservation, interactions must include sparticles in pairs---a single sparticle can only decay to another sparticle and some number of SM particles.
This requirement stabilizes the LSP; after being produced, it is left with no kinematically allowed decays and wonders the universe indefinitely until it annihilates with another sparticle.

Whether the LSP is charged or neutral depends on free parameters of the MSSM. A charged LSP, however, would form bound states with SM particles.
Given that no such states have been observed~\cite{chargedlsp} a charged LSP seems unlikely. A neutral LSP, on the other hand, should interact only through the weak force and gravitation. SUSY enthusiasts tout this prediction of a \emph{weakly interacting massive particle} (WIMP) as a major success of the theory; as discussed in \cref{sec:dm} considerable astronomical evidence supports the existence of such a particle.

\subsection{Naturalness and ``Breaking'' SUSY}
In the simplest case, sparticles in the MSSM are exact replicas of their SM superpartners down to coupling strengths.
This assumption is important because it mitigates the Higgs mass corrections and unnatural tuning mentioned in \cref{sec:yukawa}. More specifically, assuming a fermion with Yukawa coupling $\Gamma_f$, the correction to the Higgs mass ($\Delta m_{h}$) is given by
\begin{equation}
  \Delta m_{h}^2 = - \frac{|\Gamma_f|^2}{8 \pi^2} \left(\cutoff^2 + \ldots \right)
\end{equation}
where $\cutoff$ is the cutoff scale for the theory.
At face value this correction isn't problematic; free parameters of the standard model can be tuned, leaving mathematically consistent even if $\cutoff$ is taken to infinity. In fact, under alternative regularization schemes $\cutoff$ won't appear at all, so it's tempting to dismiss the Higgs mass fine-tuning as a non-physical artifact.

The problem is that the fine-tuning \emph{is} physical if any additional particles are added to the standard model, and given the known incompleteness of the standard model accommodating new particles is essential. As a simple example, adding a new scalar particle with mass $m_{s}$ and Yukawa coupling $\Gamma_s$ results in a mass correction
\begin{equation}
  \Delta m_{h}^2 = \frac{\Gamma_s}{16 \pi^2} \left(\cutoff^2 - 2m_s^2 \ln(\cutoff / m_s) + \ldots \right).
  \label{eq:higgs-correction-scalar}
\end{equation}
In this case, the $m_{s}$ term is undeniably physical.
By extension, the Higgs mass receives a correction proportional to the mass of each new particle with a Yukawa interaction.\footnote{\Cref{eq:higgs-correction-scalar} applies to scalars with a direct Yukawa coupling, but particles which couple indirectly to the Higgs still result in corrections of the same order, as do particles with spin 1/2 or 1.} This correction is problematic considering the scale on which new particles are expected; the strong coupling constant should intersect with the electroweak couplings at the scale of the so-called \emph{grand unified theory} (GUT), roughly $\Lambda_{\text{GUT}} \approx 10^{16}\,\gev$. Particles with masses so far above the electroweak scale ($\Lambda_{\text{EW}} \approx 1\,\tev$) result in a Higgs fine-tuning of order $\Lambda_{\text{GUT}} / \Lambda_{\text{EW}} \approx 10^{13}$.
To make matters worse, the GUT scale is only the lower of two suggestive energy scales.
Unification of the strong, electroweak, and gravitational force is expected at energies roughly a thousand times higher, around $10^{19}\,\gev$.

One of the first recognized strengths of SUSY was it's ability to cancel these corrections.
