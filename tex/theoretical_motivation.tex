\chapter{Theoretical Motivation}

The Standard Model (SM) consists of 17 fundamental particles which together constitute every observed particle and most of the known forces.
It provides a remarkably precise fit to the majority of particle physics data, predicted the $W$, $Z$, and Higgs bosons~\cite{wzmass1,higgs1,higgs2} decades before their discovery~\cite{ua1w,ua2w,ua1z,ua2z,atlashiggs,cmshiggs}.
For all its success, however, the Standard Model is an incomplete model of physics.

This is by design.
