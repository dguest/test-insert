\chapter{Theoretical Motivation}

The Standard Model (SM) consists of 17 fundamental particles which together constitute every observed particle and most of the known forces. It provides a remarkably precise fit to the majority of particle physics data, and predicted the $W$, $Z$, and Higgs bosons~\cite{wzmass1,higgs1,higgs2} decades before their discovery~\cite{ua1w,ua2w,ua1z,ua2z}.
