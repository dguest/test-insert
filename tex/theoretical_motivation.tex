\chapter{Theoretical Motivation}

The Standard Model (SM) consists of 17 fundamental particles which together constitute every observed particle and most of the known forces.
It provides a remarkably precise fit to the majority of particle physics data, predicted the $W$, $Z$, and Higgs bosons~\cite{wzmass1,higgs1,higgs2} decades before their discovery~\cite{ua1w,ua2w,ua1z,ua2z,atlashiggs,cmshiggs}.
For all its success, however, the Standard Model is an incomplete model of physics.

This is by design. The Standard Model is a verifiable and self-consistent description of the strong, weak, and electromagnetic interactions, but by definition it omits many phenomena.
Historically, the first such omission was gravitation; even today any attempts to incorporate gravity into particle theory are extremely speculative.
Recent observations have pointed to other glaring omissions:
neutrinos, massless in the Standard Model, clearly have mass;
the cosmos is filled with roughly 5 times more `dark matter' than the SM matter we've observed;
and the Standard Model lacks any means to produce the matter-antimatter asymmetry we see in the universe.
%% Furthermore, the Higgs mass itself

The Standard Model isn't \emph{wrong}, it's simply reached the limit of it's predictive power.
