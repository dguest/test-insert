\section{``Phenomenology''}
\label{sec:pheno}
Not sure if there's a better title, basically an intro to how particles
look in the real world. My dad would like this.
\subsection{Pions, Electrons, and Muons}
(we don't actually see anything else)
\subsection{Neutrinos (and Neutrilinos)}
\subsection{Taus, and Heavy Quarks}
(we can reconstruct these from the earlier three)
introduce secondary-vertex--based tagging here
\subsection{W, Z, Higgs, and Everything Else}
Invariant mass and charge conservation
\subsection{RPC Feynman Diagramns for Grandma}
Just add masses and pick a vertex! (be sure to obey conservation of $\sim$)
