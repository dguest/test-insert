In the interest of sending this dissertation to my readers as quickly as possible, I've omitted a more detailed list of acknowledgments. Briefly:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Thanks to Keith, for hiring me 
\end{enumerate}

%% Thanks to my advisers, Tobias and Paul, for making this work possible, and to Keith for introducing me to high energy physics.
%% Thanks also to Witold Skiba, both for reading this dissertation and for several helpful conversations over the last several years.
%% I also owe a great deal to collaborators at Oxford and CERN, and to my family and friends. They will be named in the coming days.
