I've kept my encouragements short for the benefit of my readers, but this will be expanded in due course.
Thanks to my advisers, Tobias and Paul, for making this work possible, and to Keith for introducing me to high energy physics.
Thanks also to Witold Skiba, both for reading this dissertation and for several helpful conversations over the last several years.
I also owe a great deal to collaborators at Oxford and CERN, and to my family and friends. They will be named in the coming days.
