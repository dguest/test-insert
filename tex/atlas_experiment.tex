%% While currently the world's most powerful and expensive particle collider, the LHC was designed to use existing infrastructure where possible to mitigate costs.
%% The vast majority of the machine was designed to fit in the tunnel bored for the Large Electron-Positron collider in the 1980s.

\section{The \atlas\ Detector}
\label{sec:atlas}
\begin{itemize}
\item Maybe put \cref{sec:pheno} here?
\item Mention how systematics work here (mention how they can be correlated between regions)
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Trigger}
\label{sec:trigger}
Brief summary of the trigger.
\begin{itemize}
\item Must introduce ``offline'' and ``online'' (referenced later)
\item Cite Will Butt~\cite{atlas-lvl1}.
\item Must discuss prescaling
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Data Acquisition and Processing}
\begin{itemize}
\item Concept of a run (referenced later)
\end{itemize}
\subsection{\atlas\ Software and Simulation}
\label{sec:software}
\begin{itemize}
\item \atlas\ geometry model
\item mention how simulation is sometimes weighted
\item concept of a signal grid (and signal ``point'')
\end{itemize}
