The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a 26.7 km long circular particle accelerator which sits roughly 100 m below ground outside Geneva Switzerland~\cite{lhc-machine}.
Throughout the ring, 1,232 dipole magnets, each $16.5\,\text{m}$ long, bend the two counter-rotating proton beams into a circular path, while numerous quadrupole, sextupole, and octupoles focus the beams. Radio frequency cavities accelerate the protons from an initial injection energy of $450\,\gev$ to a collision energy of up to $14\,\tev$.
%% The beams collide at four interaction points within underground detector halls.



%% At design energy, two counter-rotating beams of protons collide at 4 defined interaction points with a proton-proton center of mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 14\,\text{TeV}$.

\subsection{The Injection Chain}
Protons in the LHC begin as hydorgen gas which is ionized by a duoplasmatron proton ion source and injected into Linac 2. These protons leave Linac 2 with an energy of $50\,\mev$ and enter the Proton Synchrotron Booster (PSB).
Over roughly one second, the PSB accelerates the protons to $1.4\,\gev$ and injects them into the Proton Synchrotron (PS). Following two fills from the PSB, the PS accelerates the protons to $25\,\gev$ and injects them into the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS).


\subsubsection{Power Use}
The LHC uses about 4\% of the energy of Geneva~\cite{lhc-energy}. Half is on cryogenics.
\begin{itemize}
\item LHC cryogenics 27.5 MW
\item LHC experiments 22 MW
\item CERN 180 MW
\item Geneva 1.3 GW
\end{itemize}

%% While currently the world's most powerful and expensive particle collider, the LHC was designed to use existing infrastructure where possible to mitigate costs.
%% The vast majority of the machine was designed to fit in the tunnel bored for the Large Electron-Positron collider in the 1980s.


\section{The \atlas\ Detector}
\label{sec:atlas}
\begin{itemize}
\item Maybe put \cref{sec:pheno} here?
\item Mention how systematics work here (mention how they can be correlated between regions)
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Trigger}
\label{sec:trigger}
Brief summary of the trigger.
\begin{itemize}
\item Must introduce ``offline'' and ``online'' (referenced later)
\item Must discuss prescaling
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Data Acquisition and Processing}
\begin{itemize}
\item Concept of a run (referenced later)
\end{itemize}
\section{\atlas\ Software and Simulation}
\label{sec:software}
\begin{itemize}
\item \atlas\ geometry model
\item mention how simulation is sometimes weighted
\item concept of a signal grid (and signal ``point'')
\end{itemize}
