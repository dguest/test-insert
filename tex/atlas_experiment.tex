\section{The \atlas\ Detector}
\begin{itemize}
\item Maybe put \cref{sec:pheno} here?
\item Mention how systematics work here (mention how they can be correlated between regions)
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Trigger}
\label{sec:trigger}
Brief summary of the trigger.
\begin{itemize}
\item Must introduce ``offline'' and ``online'' (referenced later)
\item Must discuss prescaling
\end{itemize}
\section{\atlas\ Software and Simulation}
\label{sec:software}
\begin{itemize}
\item \atlas\ geometry model
\item mention how simulation is sometimes weighted
\item concept of a signal grid (and signal ``point'')
\end{itemize}
