The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a 26.7 km long circular synchrotron which sits roughly $100\,\textrm{m}$ below ground outside Geneva Switzerland.
As the world's most powerful particle accelerator, it marks the epicenter of several worldwide collaborations involving thousands of physicists.
The accelerator itself contains two counter-rotating proton beams which cross at four interaction points. At these points protons collide head-on.
The products of these collisions are measured by four experiments: ALICE is optimized for collisions between lead nuclei; LHCb is specifically designed to measure $b$-hadron decays; ATLAS and CMS are designed to detect and measure a wide range of particles in and beyond the standard model.
%% The beams collide at four interaction points within underground detector halls.
