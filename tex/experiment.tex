\chapter{The Experiment}

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a 26.7 km long circular synchrotron which sits roughly $100\,\textrm{m}$ below ground outside Geneva Switzerland.
As the world's most powerful particle accelerator, it marks the epicenter of several worldwide collaborations involving thousands of physicists.
The accelerator itself contains two counter-rotating proton beams which cross at four interaction points. At these points protons collide head-on.
The products of these collisions are measured by four experiments: ALICE is optimized for collisions between lead nuclei; LHCb is specifically designed to measure $b$-hadron decays; ATLAS and CMS are designed to detect and measure a wide range of particles in and beyond the standard model.
%% The beams collide at four interaction points within underground detector halls.

Anyone with a solid background in the \atlas\ experiment can safely skip this chapter, which is structured as follows: \cref{sec:cern} gives a short introduction to CERN; \cref{sec:pheno} introduces some prerequisite concepts to \cref{sec:injector,sec:lhc,sec:atlas}; \cref{sec:injector,sec:lhc} discuss the injector chain and the LHC; and \cref{sec:atlas} describes the \atlas\ detector.
